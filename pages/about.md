# **About Me**

Hi I am **{{ site.author.name }}** :wave:, and I am an engineering student at the [Olin College of Engineering](https://www.olin.edu/), studying engineering with computing. I am really interested in largescale software development, machine learning, and firmware.

At Olin, I am heavily involved in on-campus research and our [Formula SAE](https://www.fsaeonline.com/) team. 

Currently, I am a researcher in the [Olin College Crowdsourcing and Machine Learning Laboratory](http://occam.olin.edu/), which develops accessible technologies for individuals who are visually impaired and blind. I am currently focusing on benchmarking one of our apps, [InvisibleMap](/projects/1-invisible-map-benchmarking), and using that data to make design improvements.

I am also leading the Vehicle Integration and Optimization subteam of [Olin Electric Motorsports](https://pages.olin.edu/human-augmentation-lab/), where I am leading efforts to develop the team's [infrastructure]() and advanced research projects (like regenerative breaking and launch control) to optimize our vehicle's performance.

During my first year, I had the chance to work in Olin's [Human Augmentation Laboratory](https://pages.olin.edu/human-augmentation-lab/), which is investigating how augmented reality can enhance daily life. Towards this goal, I developed a [hand signal classification system]() that can classify a user's hand signal in real-time, triggering a response on an augmented reality headset.

In my free time, I love spending time at the gym or rock climbing, playing the tuba, and going to [Dunkin](https://www.dunkindonuts.com/en).
